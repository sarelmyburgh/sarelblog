For a long time I've used Wordpress with the [Divi](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/) theme to make websites. It worked well, but to be honest, I never actually used the websites that much. This meant that I usually end up paying for hosting for a website that I don't really use.

In order to combat that (and learn some new skills) I figured I would try out this whole "Jamstack" thing I keep hearing about. Apparently you can host websited online for free, just need to pay for a proper domain name. And thus, this blog was born.

It's nothing too fancy. I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with the ["Hello-friend-ng"](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/) theme.

I will admit, this took me way longer to make than I expected. I tried to use Github Pages at first, but I just couldn't get it to work properly. So now I'm on Netlify.

This was also my first real foray into the world of Git. Despite playing around with python and flutter, I've never really used Github before.  I just made my things in Repl.it. Now I need to use Github. I also can't get away with some lazy WYSIWYG editor either. 

Let's see what will happen.
