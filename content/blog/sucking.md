*As of today, 28 July, 2021, I suck at hacking.*

Why do I say this? Because for the past few days I attempted the final three black box labs in the [INE Penetration Testing Student path](https://my.ine.com/CyberSecurity/learning-paths/a223968e-3a74-45ed-884d-2d16760b8bbd/penetration-testing-student). And I failed specatacularly. Apart from some basic enumeration, I was barely able to scratch the surface of the boxes. These are entry level things.

I thought that finishing 41 rooms on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/signup?referrer=PSyCHoH4x0r) and cruising through the INE course meant I would be ready. I was so wrong.

I suck. I am not even at script kiddie level yet.

And you know what? ***That's okay***.

I only got started on the cybersecurity journey at the end of May. Before that, the closest I've ever come to hacking is changing the password field to text in the browser so that I can see the clear text instead of a bunch of asterix'.

*BUT* I know more than I did at the start of May. I can now scan a network with nmap. I can manipulate HTML requests with Burp Suite. I can (sometimes) crack a hash with John the Ripper and launch an exploit with Metasploit. These are things I did not know two months ago.

Yes, I suck at hacking right now, but next month, I will be better. The month after that, even more so. As long as I keep persisting, I will get there.

I won't be able to meet my goal of completing the eJPT certificate by the end of July, but who knows? Maybe next month I will be good enough.
