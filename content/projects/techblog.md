## Why?

A career in IT is become more and more like one in the arts. Steadily, more emphasis is being placed on your portfolop and past experience, rather than on your qualifications. This blog serves to be my public portfolio. The thing potential employers can look at when they decide whether or not they want to hire me.

After several attempts at maintaining a Wordpress website, I decided that it's just not worth the hassle for something that won't get much traffic anyway.

## How?

I've decided on going off the beaten path frequented by amateur web developers and started doing research on static site generators. I ultimately settled on Hugo.

At first I just played around with it, testing out different themes and getting familiar with the Git command line, as well as Hugo itself. Once I ~knew~ thought I had it down, I had to decide on where I would host my site.

At first I tried to host it on Github Pages, but, likely due to my inexperience, I couldn't get it to work. In retrospect, it was probably some small mistake on my end. So, I went with Netlify. I was once again met with a few hiccups, but overall it was an easier process than Github Pages and I managed to get my site working.

## The end product

And that is how I ended up with this blog. Is it the final product? Probably not. Did I learn a lot? I sure did.

## Lessons learned

### Git
This project really got me into Git. I have never used Git before and had to watch some YouTube tutorials to figure out how it works.

### Jamstack
I have heard the phrase "Jamstack" being thrown around, but I have never really looked into what it was, what it meant, or how it could benefit me. This blog was my first taste of what it was. I will probably use it a lot more often from now on.

### Markdown
Sure, I've heard of markup, I know HTML when I see it, I understand what it does and how it works, but this was my first time hearing about mark*down*. So far, it actually seems a bit easier to read, write and understand than HTML.
