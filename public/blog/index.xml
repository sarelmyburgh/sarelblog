      <description>As of today, 28 July, 2021, I suck at hacking.
Why do I say this? Because for the past few days I attempted the final three black box labs in the INE Penetration Testing Student path. And I failed specatacularly. Apart from some basic enumeration, I was barely able to scratch the surface of the boxes. These are entry level things.
I thought that finishing 41 rooms on TryHackMe and cruising through the INE course meant I would be ready.</description>

      <description>For a long time I&amp;rsquo;ve used Wordpress with the Divi theme to make websites. It worked well, but to be honest, I never actually used the websites that much. This meant that I usually end up paying for hosting for a website that I don&amp;rsquo;t really use.
In order to combat that (and learn some new skills) I figured I would try out this whole &amp;ldquo;Jamstack&amp;rdquo; thing I keep hearing about.</description>
